# NLP Capstone Preparation: Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of projects and resources focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning. It documents my learning journey and progress through various topics and implementationsâ€”all in preparation for my capstone project, "Do the LLMs Know What/Where and Why They Lack?" Through these projects, I'm building the necessary skills and insights to tackle key challenges in LLM self-refinement and performance.
